Database code generators for varying platforms and vendors.
===========================================================

There are three code generator types written using the same mechanism.
This mechanism or paradigm follow the same coding pattern. There is a
parser generator or compiler compiler written using javacc for the tokenising
and grammar parsing. Each defines a domain specific language with some crossover
capabilities. These generators are written in plain old java and they are maintained
in Eclipse, but any text editor and javac would suffice to maintain them. They 
produce a generic class network database. They use public members and are not getter 
setter based classes. They also have a minimum of methods. They produce a tree structure
of the compiled source.

The compiled tree then is available to be used by generators to compile code to be
used by any computer language, current or future. This system has been used for many
projects and applications over the last 20 years, very successfully.
